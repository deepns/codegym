## Daily log - attempt#2

Been a while I lost in touch with my daily exercise. Restarting the practice.

### Day 7 (grpc echo server)

- added a echo server, with proto definition and client and server code
- added a simple echo and server side streaming
- will add client side streaming and bidirectional streaming tomorrow
- read the tutorial page again...finding new information on each read

### Day 6

- went over some patterns from educative

### Day 5 (go contexts)

- More on go contexts
- added a sample program to my learning collection

### Day 4 (go contexts)

- Learning about go contexts

### Day 3 (grpc helloworld, go context)

- Went through the grpc generated code
- Updated the arguments
- started reading about context package...will explore more on that tomorrow.

### Day 2 (grpc helloworld)

- Wrote my own helloworld program on grpc with go
- defined the proto file, explored the marshaling and unmarshalling of proto buffers
- implemented the server and client to test request and response processing
- what next?
  - [ ] Read the auto generated files and understand how they are used in general
  - [ ] add comments as necessary

### Day 1 (grpc basics)

- running protoc with go requires the extension (protoc-gen-go and protoc-gen-go-grpc). Installed them using `go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.28` and `go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.2`

```console
‚ûú  ~ ls $HOME/go/bin
inputs             protoc-gen-go      protoc-gen-go-grpc tempfiles
‚ûú  ~ export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

- went through the [routeguide example](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/tree/master/examples/route_guide), server code and client code. Ran them. what next?
  - [x] create a route guide client on my own to interact with the server
  - [ ] create my own server and client
- server listens at `50051` by default. Unfortunately, that port is already taken by launchd.

```console
‚ûú  ~ sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN | grep 50051
launchd      1     root   11u  IPv6 0x70998e80006793b3      0t0  TCP *:50051 (LISTEN)
launchd      1     root   50u  IPv4 0x70998e76698d643b      0t0  TCP *:50051 (LISTEN)
```

  - #signal handling - handling return values

  - #signal handling - sigio on non-blocking sockets. This turned out to be a good learning. Tried to read from nonblocking sockets. apparently, sigio tells us only one fd even when multiple file descriptors are ready. I thought a signal would be delivered independently for each fd that is registered with O_ASYNC. I guess we should maintain the list of nonblocking fds to read, when SIGIO is fired, attempt read from all of them.
